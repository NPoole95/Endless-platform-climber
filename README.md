This third year assignment involved creating a game that was suitable for deployment as a WebGL project using Unity

The game is quite simple, the user controls a grasshopper that wants to try and climb as high as possible, landing on a branch will allow the grasshopper to jump higher, 
however the player must do their best to avoid the dangerous trap branches.

THe main goal of the project was to create a game that could be deployed as a WebGL project and was, for a time, hosted on one of the university servers, accessible through the web,
however this is no longer the case. A link to a video demonstrating the game can be found in a text file in the repository.

The project also successfully implemented the Facebook API to allow users to login using their social media accounts, this allowed their names and scores to be recorded in a high score table to compete against others.
